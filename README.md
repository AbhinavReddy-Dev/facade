# Facade Pattern
## Deisgn Patterns and Best Practices in TypeScript

This is a deisgn pattern that is often implemented in OOPS based projects to organise the code for optimisation, reusability, and readability.

Maintainability of the this pattern is limited to the number of abstraction layers implemented. 

Folder structure:
```shell
|
src
    |
    - index.ts
    - facade.ts
    - product.ts
    - cart.ts
    - types.ts
package-lock.json
package.json
README.md
tsconfig.json
yarn.lock
```
    
To run the implemetation
```shell 
yarn start
```
